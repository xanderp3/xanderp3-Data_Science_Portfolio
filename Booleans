# Booleans

# Boolean is a data type in which the only two values are True and False

print(4 == 4)
print(2 == 4)

# Relational Operators:
# ==
# >
# <
# >=
# <=

# Common Mistake:
# =<
# =>

print(2 <= 2)

print(2 < 1.)

print(2 == 2.)


# When it comes to booleans een if the data types are different (e.g. 1 string) and 1 int, the values are compared.
# For example 1., the float is equal to 1, the int.

print(True + False + True + 5)

#Strings
print('Hello')

#ints
print(10)

#floats
print(1.75)

#booleans
print(True)

# All of the above are known as 'literals'
# 'literals hold the same value as theire label'
# To check a data type:
print(type('Hello'))
